## About

This website is a simple showcase of Tailwind CSS and its capabilities, that acts as a sort of advertisement website for the game "Outer Wilds". It showcases the planets in the game's solar system and a synopsis of the game as well.

The project includes:

* A Section with a background video and a link to the game's website.
* A Section for showcasing the different planets in the game's solar system, all acting as links to the Outer Wilds Wiki, for more information.
* A Synopsis of the game to the side of the planet cards.
* A footer with author credit.
