Project for **MIST Web Dev Bootcamp Week 3** focused on learning the basics of Javascript.

## About

This website is a simple showcase of Javascript and its capabilities, in the form of a basic calculator.

The project includes:

* A gradient background with a calculator in the center, with all buttons styled using css, a major part of the design choice being dark gradients.
* A js script to ensure the intended working of the calculator.
* A display section within the calculator that constantly updates with each operation and input.

## What I Learned

* Creating the skeleton of a web page using HTML.
* Styling the calculator and its buttons to my liking using CSS.
* Using grids and operating on specifc rows and columns to maintain the calculator layout.
* Writing javascript code to perform calculations without using functions such as eval().
